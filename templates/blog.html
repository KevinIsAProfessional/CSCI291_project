<h1>Blog Home Page</h1>

<p>I'll put a blog here, to say stuff. I don't know what yet, but I can't seem to stop talking to myself, so I must have <i>something</i> to say, right?</p>
<p>I "host" a writing group every Wednesday night, and I've thought about putting those writings here. Stay tuned.</p>
